# 🎮 Video Games Reviews Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a dataset of **47,000+ video game reviews** to extract insights on user ratings, pricing impact, platform preferences, and key factors influencing game success. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization**, we uncover trends that drive the gaming industry.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Analyze **user ratings and reviews** to determine game popularity.
- Identify **top-rated genres and platforms**.
- Examine the correlation between **game pricing and user ratings**.
- Apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract sentiment from reviews.
- Visualize key trends in the gaming industry.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source:** Video game reviews dataset
- **Size:** 47,000+ reviews
- **Columns:** Game title, platform, genre, price, rating, review text, etc.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data Cleaning & Processing
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data Visualization
  - `scipy`, `statsmodels` – Statistical Analysis
  - `nltk`, `textblob` – Sentiment Analysis

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Distribution of Ratings**: Understanding the most common ratings given by users.
- **Pricing vs. Ratings**: Do expensive games get better ratings?
- **Genre Popularity**: Which game genres are most favored?
- **Platform Trends**: What are the top platforms for highly rated games?
- **Review Sentiments**: Analyzing user opinions through NLP.

## 📈 Key Findings
✅ **RPG & Action genres** receive the highest ratings.
