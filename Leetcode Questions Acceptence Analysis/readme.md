# Leetcode Questions Acceptance Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **Leetcode questions** based on their acceptance rates, difficulty levels, and other relevant factors. The goal is to uncover trends that can help developers optimize their learning strategies and problem-solving approaches.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset contains information about Leetcode questions, including:
- **Question ID**
- **Title**
- **Difficulty Level (Easy, Medium, Hard)**
- **Acceptance Rate**
- **Tags (Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.)**
- **Total Submissions**
- **Total Accepted Solutions**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis

## üîç Key Insights
- The **acceptance rate** is generally higher for **Easy** questions compared to **Hard** ones.
- Certain problem tags (e.g., **Arrays, Strings**) have a higher acceptance rate than others (e.g., **Graphs, Dynamic Programming**).
- The number of submissions is **not always proportional** to acceptance rate‚Äîsome highly attempted questions remain difficult.
- **Medium-level questions** show the most variation in acceptance rates, making them a key focus for improving problem-solving skills.

## üìà Visualizations
- **Difficulty-wise Acceptance Rate Distribution**
- **Top vs. Bottom Performing Question Tags**
- **Correlation Between Submissions and Acceptance Rate**
- **Trend Analysis of Most Attempted Questions**

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shubham-S151/DataAnalysis-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd DataAnalysis-Python/Leetcode_Questions_Acceptance_Analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Leetcode_quesstions_acceptence.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to explore the analysis.

## üìå Future Improvements
- **Predicting acceptance rates** for new problems using machine learning.
- **Time complexity analysis** of frequently solved problems.
- **Comparison of problem-solving trends** over time.
